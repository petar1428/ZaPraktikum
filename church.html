                What exactly should the Church represent to us?
When we say the Symbol of Faith, we say ... And in one Holy Synodal and Apostolic Church
I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins ... To begin with, I would like to quote the great Bishop
Nikolai who says "Passengers, here is the ship, when there was a flood, the ostrich was saved in a safe ship. The flood
insanity and sin are constantly going on. That is why the philanthropist built the ark of salvation. Ask for His ark and enter quickly. "

It is this ship that is more than just an ordinary building as some call it, that ship has always been a safety for us that sails
on the way to salvation towards the Kingdom of Heaven to which all of us believers aspire. This ship is commanded by the Holy Spirit as a captain.
that very center is Christ, but in order to establish a connection with that center, it is not only important to be a part of the ship, we must live morally according to all God's laws. Reason alone justifies the need for faith, because a man without faith is like a man who is blind and wandering. to the soul there is no spark of love but of hatred, he cannot bear the Church or the image of Christ

but he is constantly looking for excuses for his vanity and his inner anger, which certainly does not bring him anything good, as you sow, so hope, everyone who cultivates love in his heart, will be loved by him
The Church is the work of the Lord based on a solid stone that symbolizes our saving faith. "On this stone I will build my Church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it" (Matthew 16:18). So to this day we see now at this time of this so-called diseases, many avaricious people and bad rulers try to strike at Orthodoxy, but Orthodoxy does not give up.
The faith of Christ is truly the faith of strong and truth-loving people, which is witnessed by many great martyrs who suffered for Christ and who will be glorified forever.
The church is also called conciliar, because it gathers all its family under its auspices and which calls for salvation. The Orthodox Church does not have the task of ruling as shown by the Catholic
The Church in which the Pope of Rome represents the head and thus replaces the role of Christ, the task of the Orthodox Church is to serve because we are not slaves but sons, sons of God!</p>
